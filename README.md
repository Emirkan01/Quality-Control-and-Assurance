# IE326 – Quality Control and Assurance: Control Charts on US Unemployment Data

This repository contains the project work completed as part of the IE326 course in the Industrial Engineering Department. The project demonstrates the application of statistical process control (SPC) techniques—typically used in manufacturing—to the analysis of the U.S. unemployment dataset from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

## Project Overview

### Data Source
- **Dataset:** The unemployment dataset is sourced from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/).
- **Structure:** The data is organized with rows representing individual years and columns corresponding to months of each year.

### Control Chart Implementation
- **X-bar Chart:** Monitors the average monthly unemployment rate per year.
- **R-bar Chart:** Monitors the range (variation) of unemployment rates across months within each year.
- **Statistical Methods:** Control limits (Upper Control Limit, Lower Control Limit, and Center Line) are computed using standard SPC formulas and constants (e.g., \( A_2 \), \( D_3 \), \( D_4 \)).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted to understand trends, detect anomalies, and prepare the dataset for control chart creation.
- Utilizes visualizations such as line plots and histograms to reveal underlying patterns and potential outliers.

### How It Works
- Data Processing: The dataset is formatted so that each row corresponds to a year and each column to a month.
- Control Charts: X-bar and R-bar charts are generated by calculating appropriate control limits based on the data.
- EDA: Statistical summaries and visualizations are provided to give insights into the unemployment trends before constructing the control charts.
